# VBA-Projects
Excel spreadsheets are nowadays one of the most usable tools in almost any workplace, adopted by functional departments across enterprise, thanks to its simplicity, speed and efficiency.

However, one of the most prominent challenges that excel users face is to work with manual "repetitive" process - the kind of task that is, on the one hand, vital to the daily business operation, but on the other hand, is usually considered as "boring" or "exhausted".

Being motivated to solve the pain points and after experiencing them by myself in daily activities of Sales Operations, I developed the solution "VBA scripts for non-technical users". The project aims to automate most popular excel processes, to free users from being trapped in repetitive & exhausted activities, which gradually reduce their productivity.

One special feature of the guidelines: They are simply "copy-and-paste" for non-technical business users and require no preexisting coding knowledge.

Enjoy Automating!
